### AI Agent for Automated Website Testing

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Bindu WebQA Agent** is an AI-powered system for automated website testing using natural language instructions.

It provides an interactive and user-friendly **Web UI** built on top of the **browser-use framework**, enabling AI agents to interact with real websites through a graphical interface. This makes browser automation **accessible, observable, and easy to control**.

The Web UI supports multiple **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, persistent browser sessions, custom browser integration, and automated web interaction workflows.
