Reports

This folder stores exported test run reports generated by the CLI and the FastAPI server.

Report files
| Type | Filename pattern | When it is created | What it contains |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| JSON | `run_<timestamp>_<random>.json` | Every run | Full run record: status, timings, scenario snapshot, per-step results, errors, and file paths |
| PDF  | `run_<timestamp>_<random>.pdf`  | Only if `reportlab` is installed | Human-friendly report view with summary + step table (and screenshot where available) |

How it is generated

CLI  
Option `5` (Run approved) executes the approved scenario and writes the JSON report (and PDF when enabled).

API  
`POST /api/run` executes the approved scenario and writes the same exports.

Debugging tip

If a run fails, open the JSON report first. It contains the failing step index, the action type, the selector used, and the exact error message.
